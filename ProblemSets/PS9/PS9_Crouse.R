#    6. RM        average number of rooms per dwelling
#    7. AGE       proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
#    8. DIS       weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
#    9. RAD       index of accessibility to radial highways
#    10. TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
#    11. PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
#    12. B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
#    13. LSTAT    lower status of the population
#    14. MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
