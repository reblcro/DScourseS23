\section*{About Me}
\subsection*{My background}

I'm in my second year as an accounting Ph.D. student. Before I came to OU, I worked for five years in the tax group at a global alternative investment manager where I managed various aspects of the firm's U.S. tax and some international compliance. Prior to that job, I worked in tax at Ernst \& Young, primarily on compliance for financial services clients. I have been married since 2016 and have a son who will be two years old in April. I enjoy spending time with my family, cooking, and taking my son to the park.

\subsection*{Why did I enroll in ECON 5253?}

I'm interested in becoming better at programming and data gathering. I believe there are many possibilities within accounting research to better utilize big data, data scraping and machine learning. My goals for this class are to utilize the final project for my second year summer paper and gain a solid foundation in big data and machine learning that I can build on in the future.

\subsection*{Post-graduation plans}

My goal is to become a professor at a research university, focused on tax research.
